  abstract = 	 {We consider the problem of efficiently exploring the arms of a stochastic bandit to identify the best subset. Under the PAC and the fixed-budget formulations, we derive improved bounds by using KL-divergence-based confidence intervals. Whereas the application of a similar idea in the regret setting has yielded bounds in terms of the KL-divergence between the arms, our bounds in the pure-exploration setting involve the Chernoff information between the arms. In addition to introducing this novel quantity to the bandits literature, we contribute a comparison between the “racing” and “smart sampling” strategies for pure-exploration problems, finding strong evidence in favor of the latter.}

abstract = {Abstract Working with multiple regression analysis a researcher usually wants to know a comparative importance of predictors in the model. However, the analysis can be made difficult because of multicollinearity among regressors, which produces biased coefficients and negative inputs to multiple determination from presum ably useful regressors. To solve this problem we apply a tool from the co-operative games theory, the Shapley Value imputation. We demonstrate the theoretical and practical advantages of the Shapley Value and show that it provides consistent results in the presence of multicollinearity.
